ðŸ“˜ Udemy Clone â€“ Responsive Learning Platform UI

Iâ€™ve built a responsive Udemy clone using HTML, CSS, CSS animations, and media queries. This project replicates the core front-end design and responsiveness of the original Udemy platform, focusing on clean UI and seamless adaptability across devices.

ðŸ”§ Features:

Fully responsive layout (mobile, tablet & desktop)

Modern UI components: navigation bar, course cards, banners

CSS animations for interactive user experience

Media queries for adaptive design

Clean, semantic HTML structure

No JavaScript â€“ 100% HTML & CSS implementation

ðŸ“± Mobile-first design ensures a smooth user experience across all screen sizes.

This project helped me strengthen my front-end skills and practice building a real-world responsive UI.
